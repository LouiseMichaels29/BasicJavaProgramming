# Graph 
This program represents a weighted directed graph. Dijkstra's algorithm is also included.
# Usage 
Simply clone the repository or append the files into the src folder of a new Java project. Make sure the txt files are in the same location as your Java project folder. The program 
will specifiy if you want Dijkstra's algorithm or a seperate algorithm. View the txt file 'users.txt' to find available source and targest verticies. 
# What I learned 
- Graphs are common data structures used in a variety of applications. Including social networking sites and GPS. 
- Dijsktra's algorithm uses weighted edges and is a modified version of the Breadth First Search algorithm.
