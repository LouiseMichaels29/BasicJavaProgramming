# Sorting Algorithms
A program containing many useful sorting algorithms. Including quick sort, radix sort, insertion sort and merge sort. 
# Usage
Simply clone the repository or append the files into the src folder of a new Java project. Make sure the txt files are in the same location as your Java project folder. 
# What I Learned
- An array with randomly ordered elements will most likely have a better run-time using Quick Sort. 
- When we want a guarenteed run-time of O(nlog(n)), Merge Sort is the optimal choice. 
- An array consisting of very large inputs with a limited range of numbers, Radix Sort is the optimal choice. 
- Insertion Sort is most optimal for arrays containing very small inputs.
